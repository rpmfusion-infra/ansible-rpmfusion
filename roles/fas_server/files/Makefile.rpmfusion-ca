# Automates the setup of a custom Certificate Authority and provides
# routines for signing and revocation of certificates. To use, first
# customize the commands in this file and the settings in openssl.cnf,
# then run:
#
# make init
#
# Then, copy in certificate signing requests, and ensure their suffix is
# .csr before signing them with the following command:
#
# make sign
#
# To revoke a key, name the certificate file with the cert option
# as shown below:
#
# make revoke cert=foo.cert
#
# This will revoke the certificate and call gencrl; the revocation list
# will then need to be copied somehow to the various systems that use
# your CA cert.
