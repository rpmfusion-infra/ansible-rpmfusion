This directory contains variables (one per file) that are loaded into 
various playbooks. The first set of these is to allow templates to 
handle the various stages of Fedora development so we don't have to 
remember all the places that need changing. 

There's 3 states for Fedora releases:

1:

Rawhide N+1
Fedora N (stable)
Fedora N-1 (stable)

2: We branch a new release from rawhide: 

Rahide N+2
Fedora N+1 (pre)
Fedora N (stable)
Fedora N-1 (stable)

3. That release is released:

Rawhide N+1
Fedora N (stable)
Fedora N-1 (stable)
Fedora N-2 (stable)

These are controlled by some variables: 

00-FedoraCycleNumber.yaml - The current stable release
FedoraBranchedBodhi.yaml - If bodhi is enabled, If it's prebeta or postbeta
FedoraBranchedNumber.yaml - The current branched release, or 0 if it doesnt exist
FedoraBranched.yaml - true if there is a branched, false otherwise
FedoraPreviousCycleNumber.yaml - number of previous stable release
FedoraPreviousPreviousCycleNumber.yaml - number of previous previous stable release or 0
FedoraPreviousPrevious.yaml - true if there is a previous previous, otherwise false
FedoraRawhideNumber.yaml - The number of the current rawhide
Frozen.yaml - If we are frozen or not, true or false
