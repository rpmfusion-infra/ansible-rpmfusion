    This is one of the (currently as of this writing) three mirrorlist
    servers of RPM Fusion. Using mirrors.rpmfusion.org is "load balanced"
    using DNS to one of the existing mirrorlist servers. To check the
    results following command can be used:

    curl "http://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/mirrorlist?repo=free-fedora-rawhide&arch=x86_64"

    Testing a specific mirrorlist can be done using:

    curl "http://{{ inventory_hostname }}/mirrorlist?repo=free-fedora-rawhide&arch=x86_64"

    The server can be rebooted any time it is necessary without warning.
    A short downtine of one of the mirrorlist servers can easily be
    handled by the remaining servers. Longer downtimes require removal
    of the IP address from the mirrors.rpmfusion.org entry.
